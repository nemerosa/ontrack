[Continuous delivery monitoring](https://nemerosa.github.io/ontrack).

Store all events which happen in your CI/CD environment: branches, builds,
validations, promotions, labels, commits. Display this information in
dashboards. Search for builds based on statuses, issues, commits, etc. Use
this information as a powerful tool to drive your pipelines into new
directions!
