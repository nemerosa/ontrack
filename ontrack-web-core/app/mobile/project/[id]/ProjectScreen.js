/**
 * One project, on a phone: its branches.
 *
 * The desktop project page carries branch boxes with their last promotions,
 * decorations, an info drawer and a row of commands. None of that is what
 * someone opens on a phone for - they are on their way to a branch, and from
 * there to a build. So this screen is the mobile list shape and nothing else: a
 * branch per row, its star, and a tap through to it.
 *
 * The branch list is **limited and filterable**, for the same reason the project
 * list is: a project can hold hundreds of branches, and a phone shows a handful
 * of rows. The limit keeps the screen honest about that rather than pretending
 * to be a full list, and the filter is how a user reaches the branch the limit
 * left out. Both run on the server - see `MobileFilter` and `branchNamePattern`.
