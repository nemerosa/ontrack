/**
 * The interstitial: "that page is desktop only".
 *
 * A phone following a deep link - from a notification, from Slack - to a page
 * the mobile UI has no equivalent for has to land somewhere. The two easy
 * answers are both wrong. Silently serving the desktop page costs the user the
 * readable UI the redirect exists to give them; silently dropping them on the
 * mobile home loses what they came for.
 *
 * So: name the destination, and offer both ways out. Neither is taken for them.
