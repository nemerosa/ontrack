/**
 * One build, on a phone: the decision surface.
 *
 * Everything a person needs to answer "should I promote or deploy this build?"
 * and then act - what the build is, how far it has been promoted, where it is
 * deployed, whether it is green, and the two actions.
 *
 * **Validations are here on purpose**, even though validations are otherwise out
 * of scope for the mobile UI. Someone about to promote or deploy from a phone
 * needs to know whether the build passed; leaving it out would mean switching to
 * the desktop UI to check and switching back, which defeats the flow this whole
 * initiative exists to enable. They are a read-only list and nothing more - no
 * matrix, no filter, no drill-down into a run.
 *
 * The actions sit directly under the identity rather than at the foot of the
 * screen. The issue lists them last, but a validation list can be long, and a
 * user who already knows they want to promote should not have to scroll past
 * every stamp to reach the button.
