 * A workflow fired by a promotion, on the delivery map.
 *
 * It hangs off its promotion level by an *emits* edge: the workflow runs once the promotion has been
 * granted, and nothing waits for what it decides. Drawing it as a prerequisite would say the
 * promotion is gated by it - see ADR 0011.
 *
 * It names no build. Its build would always be the one its promotion level already names, so a
 * build line here would repeat that build one node to the right and lag behind it whenever the two
 * were fetched a moment apart.
