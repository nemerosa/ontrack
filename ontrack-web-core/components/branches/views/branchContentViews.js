/**
 * Registry of the branch content views: the interchangeable renderings which can fill the content
 * region of the branch view.
 *
 * Content views are peers on a single axis of choice — a content view never offers a sub-selector
 * for other content views. See `docs/adr/0001-branch-content-views.md`.
 *
 * Each entry carries:
 *
 * * `key` — stable identifier, used in the `?view=` parameter and in the user preferences
 * * `name` — label shown in the view selector
 * * `icon` — icon shown in the view selector
 * * `component` — the React component filling the content region, receiving only the `branch`
 * * `experimental` — optional, marks a view still being refined; the selector badges it
 *
 * This list is static on purpose: there is no extension point for contributing views yet. The entry
 * shape is nevertheless one a server-driven list could populate later.
