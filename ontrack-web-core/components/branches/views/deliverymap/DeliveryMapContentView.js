 * like the pipeline view it does NOT own the validation stamp filter, which lives above the view
 * switch so that a user's filter follows them from one view to the next. It reads it and narrows the
 * map by it.
 *
 * What it does own is the branch head in its header - the build every checkpoint's lag is counted
 * against - what is drawn on the map at all, and its own auto refresh. All three are ways of reading
 * this one graph rather than statements about the branch.
 *
 * The auto refresh context is provided HERE and consumed by the view below, which is why the two are
 * separate components: a component cannot read a context it provides itself.
