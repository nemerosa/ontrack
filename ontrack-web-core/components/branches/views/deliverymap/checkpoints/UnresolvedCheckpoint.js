/**
 * What the map draws in place of something a configuration named and which does not exist.
 *
 * Both slot admission rules reference their target BY NAME, inside an opaque JSON column, with no
 * referential integrity behind them: a promotion admission rule can name a promotion level the
 * branch does not have, and an environment rule can name an environment this project has no slot in.
 * Until this checkpoint existed, nothing said so - the deployment answered "Promotion not existing"
 * at the moment somebody tried to deploy, and not before.
 *
 * Drawing nothing at all was the alternative, and it is the wrong one: the map would then quietly
 * agree with the broken configuration. This is arguably the strongest thing the delivery map does.
 *
 * It is deliberately NOT a link and names no build. There is no entity behind it to link to, and
 * nothing can ever arrive at something which does not exist; a "Never reached" line would suggest
 * the thing is real and merely unvisited.
 *
 * What this must never look like is a checkpoint left out because the user may not see it. Such a
 * checkpoint is removed together with its edges and is never drawn at all - see the contributor
 * seam. If the two looked alike, people would learn to read "unresolved" as "probably just
 * permissions", and the feature would stop being trustworthy for the case it exists to catch. Hence
 * the wording here, which says what is broken rather than what is missing.
 *
 * @param checkpoint The checkpoint to draw
