/**
 * The aggregate checkpoint: one node standing for every validation stamp matched by an auto
 * promotion pattern, rather than one node per stamp.
 *
 * It is labelled with the PATTERN, because that is what the configuration actually says: everything
 * matching this, not these forty named things.
 *
 * Expanding opens a POPOVER rather than growing the node or adding graph nodes. Both of the
 * alternatives break the layout, in the same way and for the same reason: elk is given each node's
 * size before anything is rendered, so a node which grows after the fact covers whatever elk placed
 * beneath it, and new nodes re-run the layout and reshuffle the map under the user's cursor. A
 * popover is drawn outside the flow and costs the layout nothing.
 *
 * @param checkpoint The aggregate checkpoint to draw
