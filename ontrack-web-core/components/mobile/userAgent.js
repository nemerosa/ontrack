/**
 * Phone detection, from the user agent alone.

 * The middleware is the only place the mobile/desktop decision can be taken
 * early enough to be a redirect rather than a flash of the wrong UI, and the
 * only thing a middleware knows about the device is the `User-Agent` header.
 * Viewport width is a client-side fact and arrives far too late.
 *
 * User agent sniffing is a blunt instrument, so the rules below are written to
 * fail towards the desktop UI: it is the complete one, every route exists there,
 * and a phone user who lands on it can still switch. A tablet or a laptop
 * wrongly sent to the mobile UI would lose functionality with no obvious way
 * back.
 *
 * Tablets are deliberately *not* phones - they have the width for the desktop
 * UI. That is easier than it sounds in 2026: since iPadOS 13 an iPad's Safari
 * claims to be a Mac, so it never matches anything here; an Android tablet is
 * an `Android` UA *without* the `Mobile` token, which is exactly what
 * distinguishes it from an Android phone.
