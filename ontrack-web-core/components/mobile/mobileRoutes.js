/**
 * The route map: which desktop routes have a mobile equivalent, and what to
 * call the ones that do not.
 *
 * This module is the single source of truth for the mobile/desktop split, read
 * by the middleware (to decide between a redirect and the interstitial) and by
 * the interstitial itself (to name the destination).
 *
 * Adding a desktop route means deciding what a phone user following a link to it
 * should see, and that decision is recorded here. Leaving it out is not neutral:
 * the route silently gets the interstitial, which may well be right, but should
 * be a choice rather than an oversight.
 *
 * See `doc/dev-guide/ui/mobile-ui.md`.
