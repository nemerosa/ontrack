/**
 * The name filter every long mobile list carries, and the box it is typed into.
 *
 * An instance holds hundreds of projects and a project holds hundreds of
 * branches, which is more than anyone scrolls through on a phone. Both lists
 * therefore filter by name, and both filter **on the server**: the browser only
 * ever holds the answer to the last query, so a client-side filter could narrow
 * that but never reach a row the server had not already sent.
 *
 * The two screens differ in what they send - the project list has an `ILIKE`
 * pattern, the branch list a regular expression (see `branchNamePattern`) - but
 * not in how the typing is handled, which is what lives here. The subtleties
 * below were each a defect worth a comment, and they should exist once.
