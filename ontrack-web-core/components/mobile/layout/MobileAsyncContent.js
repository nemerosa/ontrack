"use client"

/**
 * The four states every mobile screen's content can be in, decided once.
 *
 * Reading a `useQuery` result correctly is fiddlier than it looks, and getting it
 * wrong is visible rather than subtle:
 *
 * - `useQuery` starts with `loading` false and only flips it inside its effect,
 *   so the very first render of a screen that trusted `loading` alone would show
 *   an empty state over data that is on its way.
 * - A screen that shows its skeleton whenever `loading` is true paints it *over*
 *   the answer it already has every time it refetches - which the favourite
 *   toggles make it do on every tap.
 *
 * So: a skeleton only until the first answer lands, the previous answer kept
 * (dimmed) while the next one is fetched, and an empty state only once a query
 * has actually finished with nothing.
 *
 * @param {{loading: boolean, error: any, finished: boolean}} state A `useQuery` result.
 * @param {string} errorMessage What to say above the error itself.
 * @param {boolean} isEmpty Whether the data that arrived is empty.
 * @param {React.ReactNode} empty What to show when it is.
 * @param {number} [rows] How tall the skeleton is.
