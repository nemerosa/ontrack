/**
 * One build, as a card.
 *
 * This is the mobile UI's one real divergence from the desktop layout rather
 * than a smaller copy of it. `BranchBuilds` renders builds as a matrix with a
 * column per validation stamp: it is wide by construction, and no amount of
 * narrowing turns a matrix into something readable at 375px. A phone gets a card
 * per build instead - what it is called, when it happened, how far it has been
 * promoted, and where it is deployed.
 *
 * Validation *status* is deliberately absent: per-stamp status is the build
 * screen's job, and a strip of validation chips here would rebuild the matrix
 * one card at a time.
 *
 * The whole head of the card is the tap target for the build screen - the card
 * carries no other control, so there is no button to nest inside a link here,
 * unlike `MobileEntityRow`. The badges below are not links: they say something
 * about this build, not about somewhere else to go.
