"use client"

/**
 * Where builds are currently deployed, asked for **separately** from everything
 * else the screen needs.
 *
 * This is not a style choice. `Build.currentDeployments` is contributed by the
 * environments extension, and `GQLBuildSlotPipelinesFieldContributor` only
 * registers it when `environmentsLicense.environmentFeatureEnabled` - so on an
 * instance without that licence the field is **absent from the schema**, not
 * merely empty. A query naming it then fails *validation*, which fails the whole
 * document: no identity, no promotions, no validations, no action buttons. A
 * mobile screen would go from "no deployments shown" to "Could not load the
 * build" on the strength of a licence it never mentions.
 *
 * The desktop UI does not hit this because its environments panel is its own
 * component with its own query - only that panel breaks. Splitting the query is
 * how the mobile screens get the same isolation: this one may fail on its own,
 * and the screen around it carries on.
 *
 * `error` is therefore an expected state, not a bug. Callers show what they can
 * and say the rest is unavailable.
