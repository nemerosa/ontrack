/**
 * One node of a [DeliveryMap], being a promotion level, a validation stamp or a slot.
 *
 * Every checkpoint names the latest build to have *arrived* at it and says what became of it there.
 * Arriving is not the same as succeeding: only a validation stamp can show a build that arrived and
 * failed. See `CONTEXT.md`.
 *
 * The exception is the [DeliveryMapCheckpointTypes.UNRESOLVED] checkpoint, which stands for a name a
 * configuration asked for and which matches nothing. It has no entity behind it and therefore no
 * arrival - see [unresolved].
 *
 * @property id Stable across fetches and unique across kinds. #1707 keeps node positions when only
 * the builds moved, and React Flow can only do that if it sees the same node ids; a regenerated id
 * remounts the node and loses its position. Build it through [DeliveryMapCheckpointTypes].
 * @property type Kind of checkpoint. Deliberately a string and not an enum: the set of kinds is open,
 * so that an extension can contribute a kind the core has never heard of. The frontend dispatches on
 * it through its own registry of checkpoint renderers.
 * @property data Kind-specific payload, read by the renderer selected by [type]. It is what carries
 * the link to the underlying entity.
 * @property members The checkpoints an *aggregate* checkpoint stands for, empty for every other kind.
 * Members are not laid out: they are shown inside their aggregate, on demand.
