    </div>

    <h3 class="mbr-section-title display-4">Introduction</h3>

    <p>Welcome to Ontrack (“Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). We respect
        your privacy and are committed to protecting it through
        our compliance with this policy (“Privacy Policy”).
    </p>

    <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose,
        and safeguard your information in connection with Ontrack
        (“the Software”), which is distributed through
        Cloud Provider Marketplaces (“Marketplace”) and
        hosted by clients in their private cloud environment
        (“Client Environment”).
    </p>

    <p>
        By accessing or using the Software, you acknowledge that you
        have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by this
        Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our policies
        and practices, do not use the Software.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mbr-section-title display-4">Data Hosting and Ownership</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Client-Hosted Data</b>: Our Software is designed to be deployed in the
            Client Environment. <b>All client data (“Client Data”) is stored and processed
            within the Client Environment</b>. We do not host or store Client Data on our servers.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Data Ownership</b>: Clients retain all rights, title, and interest to the
            data they upload, process, or store using our Software. We do not claim
            ownership of Client Data.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Access to Client Data</b>: We do not have direct access to Client Data
            within the Client Environment unless explicitly granted by the client for
            support or maintenance purposes.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="mbr-section-title display-4">Information We Collect</h3>

    <h3 class="mbr-section-title display-5">(A) Information Provided Directly by You</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Registration and Account Information</b>: When you purchase or subscribe to
            our Software through the Marketplace, we may receive basic account details -
            such as your name, email address, or billing information — from the Marketplace
            for license management and/or billing purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Support Requests</b>: If you contact us for support, we may collect contact
            information (such as name and email), case details, and any logs or additional
            information you voluntarily provide to help resolve the issue.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="mbr-section-title display-5">(B) Information Collected Automatically</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Usage Metrics</b>: Depending on the Software’s configuration, we may collect
            anonymized usage metrics (e.g., frequency of feature use, error logs) to improve
            and optimize the Software. These metrics do not include any Client Data.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Marketplace Information</b>: The Marketplace may share limited technical
            or transactional information (e.g., subscription status, license identifiers,
            usage counts) to enable license validation, billing, or renewal processes.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="mbr-section-title display-4">How We Use Information</h3>

    <p>
        We use the information we collect or receive for the following purposes:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Licensing and Account Management</b>: To manage licenses, verify authorized
            usage, and maintain user accounts.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Technical Support and Maintenance</b>: To diagnose and resolve technical
            issues. In rare cases where remote support is requested, we may be granted
            temporary access to the Client Environment under strict confidentiality agreements.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Product Improvements</b>: To analyze anonymized usage metrics and error
            data to improve the functionality, performance, and security of the Software.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Compliance and Protection</b>: To comply with applicable legal obligations,
            enforce our terms of service, and protect the rights, property, and safety of
            our Company, our users, or others.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="mbr-section-title display-4">Data Security</h3>

    <p>
        We implement reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect the
        information in our possession from unauthorized access, disclosure,
        alteration, or destruction. However, since the <b>Client Data</b> is hosted in the
        Client Environment, <b>the client</b> is responsible for implementing and
        maintaining security measures to protect the Client Data within their
        infrastructure.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mbr-section-title display-4">Data Retention</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Client Data</b>: Retained by the client as long as they use the Software.
                We do not store or control retention of this data.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Anonymized Usage Data</b>: Retained for as long as necessary for our legitimate
            business purposes (e.g., to improve the Software).
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Support Data</b>: Stored for as long as needed to resolve issues or
            comply with legal obligations.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="mbr-section-title display-4">International Transfers</h3>

    <p>
        Information we collect may be transferred to and processed in countries
        outside your jurisdiction. We will ensure any such transfers comply with
        applicable data protection laws by implementing appropriate safeguards where required.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mbr-section-title display-4">Your Rights and Choices</h3>

    <p>
        Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights in relation to
        the personal data we collect about you, such as the right to access, correct,
        or delete that information, or to object to or restrict processing of your
        data. To exercise these rights, please contact us using the information below.
    </p>

    <p>
        Please note that if you wish to exercise your rights in relation to Client Data,
        you must contact the relevant client who controls that data.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mbr-section-title display-4">Third-Party Websites and Services</h3>

    <p>
        Our Software may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not
        owned or controlled by us. We are not responsible for the privacy practices
        of such third parties. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of
        each third-party website you visit.
    </p>

        make changes, we will post the updated policy with a revised “Last Updated” date.
        Your continued use of the Software after any such update constitutes your acceptance
        of the new Privacy Policy.
