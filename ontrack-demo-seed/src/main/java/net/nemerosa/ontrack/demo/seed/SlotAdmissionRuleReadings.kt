 * The dataset's own reading of the admission rules a slot can carry.

 * gives: it talks to Yontrack over its API, not over its model classes. It is shared between
 * [validate] and `InMemoryDemoTarget` rather than written twice, because two copies of one
 * pattern reading would let the check that guards a reset drift from the fake server the unit
 * tests run the seed against - and then the tests would pass on a dataset the reset refuses.

 * would go through as a rule nobody reads rather than as a failure.
