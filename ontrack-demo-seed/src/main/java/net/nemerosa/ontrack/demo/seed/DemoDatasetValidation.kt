/**
 * Checks a dataset against the rules Yontrack would enforce, before anything is deleted.
 *
 * The seed is destructive by design, and it deletes before it creates. Without this, a
 * dataset the server rejects half-way through — an illegal name, a promotion level the
 * branch never declares — leaves the demo wiped and partly rebuilt, which is worse than
 * either the old demo or the new one. "Destructive by design" must not mean "blank on
 * failure".
 *
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException with every problem found, not just the first: fixing a
 * dataset one error per run is a poor way to spend a reset.
