     * `SECURITY.SCAN` is deliberately outside the pattern, so that the demo also shows a stamp the
     * map leaves out: only the stamps taking part in a dependency are drawn.
     *
     * #1716 sketched this differently - `BUILD` *and* `UNIT.TESTS` named, and the pattern on BRONZE -
     * and both departures are deliberate. Naming a stamp is the more specific statement of the two,
     * so a stamp named AND matched by the pattern stays its own checkpoint and leaves the aggregate
     * standing for one thing: naming `UNIT.TESTS` here would produce a one-member aggregate, which
     * teaches nothing about what an aggregate is for. And BRONZE has to stay manual, because the
     * only rule that would reproduce the BRONZE promotions the dataset already declares is the same
     * one SILVER carries - both sets are identical, and a level granted by the very rule below it
     * would be a second edge saying what the first already says.
     *
     * It reproduces the promotions the dataset already declares rather than adding any. Every build
     * below carrying SILVER is BRONZE with `BUILD` and both TESTS green, and the two that are not -
     * 103 with a failed integration test, 106 with a failed unit test - satisfy neither rule. Auto
     * promotion only ever fires for a build not already promoted, so the demo's promotions stay the
