/**
 * Resets the demo and recreates its dataset, through the Yontrack API.
 *
 * The demo's state is a function of the build, not an accumulation: the program deletes
 * every project and every environment, then recreates the dataset from scratch. Destructive
 * by design, and idempotent because of it — running it twice in a row leaves the same demo.
 *
 * Settings are covered by CasC and users live in Keycloak, so projects, environments and
 * the demo dashboard are the only things this has to reset.
 *
 * @param clock Read once per run, so every build creation time in one run shares a
 * reference. Injected so that a test can pin it and compare two runs.
