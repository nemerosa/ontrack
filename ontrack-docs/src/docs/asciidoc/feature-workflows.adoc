[[workflows]]
=== Workflows

Workflows allow the execution of several actions orchestrated in a DAG (directed acyclic graph).

[NOTE]
====
As of version 4.11, workflows can be triggered using:

* <<notifications>>
* <<environments,environment pipelines>>

There is already some partial and undocumented support through API calls to run some standalone workflows but this is very experimental.
====

[[workflow-definitions]]
==== Workflows definitions

To run a workflow, you can define a notification whose channel is `workflow`.

This can be done through the UI or as code.

[NOTE]
====
Workflows definitions in the UI is only supported in the Next UI of Ontrack and won't be supported in the legacy UI.
====

A workflow:

* has a name, used for information and display purposes
* has a list of nodes

Each node:

* has an ID which must be unique inside the workflow
* an executor ID that points to a _workflow node executor_
* some data for the _workflow node executor_
* a list of parent nodes

The list of parent nodes is what defines the workflow DAG.

[NOTE]
====
When defining or running workflows, graph cycles are automatically detected.
====

Workflows notifications can be defined as code, like all other <<notifications,notifications>>.

For example:

[source,yaml]
----
channel: workflow
channelConfig:
  workflow:
    name: My workflow
    nodes:
      - id: ticket
        executorId: notification
        data:
          channel: jira-creation
          channelConfig:
            # Configuration for the ticket creation
      - id: mail
        executorId: notification
        parents:
          - id: ticket
        data:
          channel: mail
          channelConfig:
            # Configuration for the mail
          template: |
            Link to ticket: ${workflow.ticket?path=url}
----

[[workflow-executors]]
==== Workflows nodes executors

A _workflow node executor_ is a component which is responsible to "run a node".

See <<appendix-workflow-node-executors>> for a list of all existing workflow node executors.

[[workflow-templates]]
==== Workflow templating

Many elements in the workflow definition are subject to <<appendix-templating,templating>>.

The workflow name is itself considered as a template when being run as a notification (which is the default in 4.8).

When using <<workflow-node-executor-notification,notifications as node executors>>, the configuration elements are templates as usual.

Note that for a workflow notification, the event is passed as a context element and all template functions and sources are available.

Additionally, when a notification is run as part of a workflow, a new templating function is available: `workflow`.

This function allows the access to the output data of any successful node in the workflow.

For example, let's take a workflow which:

* creates a ticket in Jira
* then send a link to this ticket with an email



[source,yaml]
----
channel: workflow
channelConfig:
  workflow:
    name: My workflow
    nodes:
      - id: ticket
        executorId: notification
        data:
          channel: jira-creation
          channelConfig:
            # Configuration for the ticket creation
      - id: mail
        executorId: notification
        parents:
          - id: ticket
        data:
          channel: mail
          channelConfig:
            # Configuration for the mail
          template: |
            Link to ticket: ${workflow.ticket?path=url}
----

The `ticket` node runs and set some information in its output (see <<notification-backend-jira-creation>> for the full details), including a `url` property.

Then, the `mail` node is run and is using the `notification` _workflow node executor_ again, with the <<notification-backend-mail,`mail` channel>> being configured to send a mail.

This channel can use the `template` for the mail's body and is using the `workflow` function to get the output of the `ticket` node and the `url` property of its output.

[[workflow-management]]
==== Workflows management

The progress of running workflows can be accessed in _Information > Workflow audit_.

Clicking on a workflow displays more details about its current status, node per node.

When using the _workflow notification channel_, the workflow status link is also accessible from the _Information > Notification recordings_, when selecting the notification.

[[workflow-settings]]
==== Workflows settings

Workflow statuses are saved by default for 14 days.

To change this value, you can go to _System > Settings > Workflows_.

This can also be defined as code using <<casc,CasC>>:

[source,yaml]
----
ontrack:
  config:
    settings:
      workflows:
        retentionDuration: 1209600000 # 14 days in ms
