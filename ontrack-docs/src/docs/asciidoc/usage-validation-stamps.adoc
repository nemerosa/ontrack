=== Managing validation stamps

[[validation-stamps-auto]]
==== Auto creation of validation stamps

Creating the validation stamps for each branch, or making sure they are
always up to date, can be a non trivial task. Having mechanisms like cloning
or <<templates,templates>> can help, but then one must still make sure
the list of validation stamps in the template is up to date and than the
template is regularly synchronized.

Another approach is to allow projects to create automatically the validation
stamps on demand, whenever a build is validated. This must of course be
authorised at project level and a list of predefined validation stamps must be
maintained globally.

[[validation-stamps-auto-predefined]]
===== Predefined validation stamps

The management of predefined validation stamps is accessible to any
_Administrator_, in his user menu.

He can create, edit and delete predefined validation stamps, and associate
images with them.

NOTE: Deleting a predefined validation stamp has no impact on the ones which
were created from it in the branches. No link is kept between the validation
stamps in the branches and the predefined ones.

[[validation-stamps-auto-projects]]
===== Configuring projects

By default, a project does not authorise the automatic creation of a validation
stamp. In case one attempts to validate a build using a non existing validation
stamp, an error would be thrown.

In order to enable this feature on a project, add the _Auto validation stamps_
property to the project and set _Auto creation_ to _Yes_.

Disabling the auto creation can be done either by setting _Auto creation_ to
_No_ or by removing the property altogether.


[[validation-stamps-auto-creation]]
===== Auto creation of validation stamps

When the auto creation is enabled, build validations using a validation stamp
name will follow this procedure:

* if the validation stamp is already defined in the branch, it is of
  course used
* if the validation stamp is predefined, it is used to create a new one on
  the branch and is then used
* in any other case, an error is displayed

IMPORTANT: The auto creation of validation stamps is available only through the
<<dsl,DSL>> or through the API. It is not accessible through the GUI, where
only the validation stamps of the branch can be selected for a build validation.

[[validation-stamps-auto-creation-if-not-predefined]]
===== Auto creation of validation stamps when not predefined

You can also configure the project so that validation stamps are created on demand, _even when
no predefined validation stamp is created_.

In this case:

* if the validation stamp is already defined in the branch, it is of
  course used
* if the validation stamp is predefined, it is used to create a new one on
  the branch and is then used
* in any other case, a new validation stamp is created in the branch, with the requested name (and with
  an empty image and a default description)

[[validation-stamps-bulk-update]]
==== Bulk update of validation stamps

Validation stamps are attached to a <<model,branch>> but in reality, they are
often duplicated in a project branches and among all the projects. Updating
the description and the image of a validation stamp can fast become cumbersome.

The <<validation-stamps-auto-predefined,predefined validation stamp>> can
mitigate but this won't solve the issue when validation stamps are created
<<validation-stamps-auto-creation-if-not-predefined,automatically>> even when
not predefined.

In order to update all the validation stamps having the same name, across all
branches and all projects, you can use the _Buld update_ command in the
validation stamp page:

image::images/validation-stamp-bulk-update.png[Bulk update]

A confirmation will be asked and all the validation stamps having the same
name, across all branches and all projects, will be updated with the same
image and the same description.

A <<validation-stamps-auto-predefined,predefined validation stamp>> will
also be updated or created.
