[[casc]]
=== Configuration as Code

Ontrack supports to be configured as code by default.
It uses a set of YAML resources defined as comma-separated list of locations by the `ontrack.config.casc.locations` configuration property.
For example, when using the environment variables:

[source]
----
ONTRACK_CONFIG_CASC_LOCATIONS=file:/path/to/file.yaml,https://path.com/file
----

All YAML resources defined by those locations are merged together according to the following rules:

* right-most files take precedence for single values
* arrays are always concatenated to each other

The list of locations can contain path to folders on a file system.
In this case, Ontrack will use all the files in this folder.

[[casc-secrets]]
==== [experimental] Casc secrets

Secrets can be injected into Casc file using this syntax:

[source]
----
{{ secret.<base>.<name> }}
----

For example:

[source,yaml]
----
some-secret-field: {{ secret.my-secret.my-property }}
----

By default, this is interpolated and evaluated using the `SECRET_<BASE>_<NAME>` environment variable,  `SECRET_MY_SECRET_MY_PROPERTY` for the example above.
If this environment variable value is `my-password`, the final Casc file will be:

[source,yaml]
----
some-secret-field: my-password
----

Alternatively, the secrets can be mapped to files by settings the `ontrack.config.casc.secrets.type` configuration property to `file` and the `ontrack.config.casc.secrets.directory` one to a valid directory.

Ontrack will then look for the secrets in files called `<base>/<name>`.

In the example above, the value of the `{{ secret.my-secret.my-property }}` expression will be looked for in the `<directory>/my-secret/my-property` file.

[NOTE]
====
The `file` secret mapping is particularly well suited for Kubernetes deployments.
See the https://github.com/nemerosa/ontrack-chart[`ontrack-chart`] for more information.

[[casc-schema]]
==== Casc schema

All those files must comply with the Ontrack CasC format.
This schema is available in the UI in the user menu at _Configuration as code_, and by clicking on the _Show_ button right of the _CasC schema_ section:

image::images/casc-schema-show.png[CasC Schema show button,200]

This goes to the page at http://localhost:8080/#/extension/casc/casc-schema :

[[casc-example]]
==== Examples

To configure the security settings so that all authenticated users have access to all the projects and can participate in all of them:

[source,yaml]
----
ontrack:
  config:
    settings:
      security:
        grantProjectViewToAll: true
        grantProjectParticipationToAll: true
----

To add an OIDC provider (<<authentication-okta,Okta>> for example):

[source,yaml]
----
ontrack:
  config:
    oidc:
      - id: okta
        name: My Okta
        description: The Okta account used by my company
        issueId: https://<okta domain>.okta.com/oauth2/default
        clientId: <Client ID of the application in Okta>
        clientSecret: <Client secret of the application in Okta>
        groupFilter: ontrack-.*
----

To add a <<integration-github,GitHub configuration>> based on an OAuth2 token:

[source,yaml]
----
ontrack:
  config:
    github:
      - name: GitHub
        token: <your secret token>
----

[[casc-control]]
==== Controls

The _Configuration as code_ configuration page is available at:

* _user menu_ > _Configuration as code_
* directly at http://localhost:8080/#/extension/casc/casc-schema

On this page, you can:

* display the schema
* see the list of locations where Ontrack fetches its CasC YAML resources
* reload the configuration as code
* display the current configuration as YAML (handy when migrating an existing installation to CasC)

Reloading the configuration as code can be done from the UI as mentioned above but also:

* through a `PUT` REST call at `/extension/casc/reload`:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X PUT --user admin <ontrack>/extension/casc/reload
----

* through the following GraphQL mutation:

[source,graphql]
----
mutation {
    reloadCasc {
        errors {
            message
        }
    }
}
----

[[casc-upload]]
==== Upload

The default Casc setup relies on files (or URL) available from the Ontrack application and in a SaaS context, these may not be available or even configurable.

A CasC upload endpoint can be enabled to allow users to upload their own Casc configuration, by using the `ontrack.config.casc.upload.enabled` <<configuration-properties-casc,configuration property>> or `ONTRACK_CONFIG_CASC_UPLOAD_ENABLED` environment property.

When done, it becomes possible to upload a YAML file, which is will be picked up next time the Casc is reloaded.
For example, given a `casc.yaml` file:

[source,bash]
----
curl --user $USER:$TOKEN \
  $URL/extension/casc/upload \
  -F "file=@casc.yaml;type=application/yaml"
----

[NOTE]
====
The user must have the _Global settings_ user rights (typically an administrator).
====

[[casc-json-schema]]
==== Using a JSON schema to edit Casc YAML files

You can download a [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) that can be used to edit Casc YAML files.

First, download this schema locally by navigating to _System_ > _Configuration as Code_.
Select _Schema_ and click on _JSON Schema_.

This offers to download an `ontrack-casc-schema.json` file: save it locally.

[NOTE]
====
The Ontrack Casc JSON schema is versioned using the Ontrack version you download it from.
====

To use it for the edition of a Casc YAML file, you can do the following in Intellij IDEA:

* in the _Settings_, select _Languages & Frameworks_ > _Schema & DTDs_ > _JSON Schema Mappings_
* in _Schema file or URL_, click on the folder icon and select the downloaded `ontrack-casc-schema.json` file
* apply and save the settings

Open a YAML file.
To associate it with the Ontrack Casc schema, click on the _Schema_ component in the bottom right corner of the file and select `ontrack-casc`.

You should now have auto-completion and validation.
