# Setup

While Yontrack can be configured using its UI, it's recommended to use the
CasC ([Configuration as Code](../configuration/casc.md)).

Find below different scenarios for configuring Yontrack using CasC.

* [GitHub Actions](configuration/github.md)
* [Jenkins pipelines](configuration/jenkins.md)

Once this setup is in place, you can start [feeding data](feeding.md) into Yontrack.
