# Branch views

A branch holds the same information whatever you came to it for, but not every question is best
answered by the same layout. Yontrack therefore offers several *content views* for a branch -
interchangeable readings of the branch, sharing the same page, the same filters and the same
permissions, and differing only in how they arrange what they show.

| View                                  | Reads the branch as                                                     |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Builds](#the-builds-view)            | a list of builds, most recent first                                     |
| [Pipeline](#the-pipeline-view)        | a promotion pipeline - what is release-ready right now                  |
| [Delivery map](#the-delivery-map-view) | a map of what a build still has to pass through to reach an environment |

They are peers: one is never reached from inside another, and none is a sub-mode of another.
**Builds** is the default, and remains so for existing users.

## Switching between views

The view is chosen from the **View** menu in the branch command bar.

![The View menu of a branch](branch-view-menu.png)

Three things follow from picking a view:

* the choice is **remembered**, so the next branch you open uses the same view;
* the choice is **linkable** - the address gains a `?view=` parameter, and a link carrying it opens
  on that view whatever the recipient's own preference is;
* an unknown or stale `?view=` value falls back to the Builds view rather than failing.

The [build filter](../build-filtering/index.md) and the validation stamp filter sit *above* the
view, not inside it. A filter you set in one view is still in force when you switch to another.

## The Builds view

The Builds view is the historical reading of a branch: one row per build, most recent first, with
the promotions reached by each build and a column per validation stamp.

![The Builds view of a branch](branch-builds-view.png)

It is the view to use when the build list itself is the subject - looking for a particular build,
comparing validation results across many builds, or selecting two builds for a
[change log](../../integrations/changelogs/changelogs.md).

## The Pipeline view

!!! warning "Experimental"

    The Pipeline view is experimental and still being refined. It is marked as such in the product,
    with a flask icon next to its entry in the View menu and a dismissible banner on the view
    itself. Feedback is welcome in
    [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/yontrack/yontrack/discussions).

    ![The experimental banner of the Pipeline view](branch-pipeline-experimental-alert.png)

The Pipeline view answers a different question: not *what has been built lately*, but *what is
release-ready right now, and what does a release still have to go through*.

![The Pipeline view of a branch](branch-pipeline-view.png)

It has four regions, in the order they answer that question.

### Branch facts

![The stats of the Pipeline view](branch-pipeline-stats.png)

The total number of builds on the branch, the latest version, and when the branch was last built.

These are facts about the **branch**, outside any filter - the total does not move when you narrow
the build filter, because a number that changes with the filter is a readout of the filter rather
than a fact about the branch.

The *latest version* is the [display name](../build-filtering/index.md#filtering-on-the-build-display-name)
of the most recent build - its release label when it has one. It is deliberately not "the most
recent build carrying a release": that is a different, more expensive question whose answer goes
stale as soon as an unlabelled build lands. On a project which does not use release labels, the
figure is omitted rather than repeating the build name shown just below.

### The promotion band

![The promotion band of the Pipeline view](branch-pipeline-stages.png)

One card per [promotion level](../model/index.md) of the branch, in promotion order: how many builds
have reached it, and which build reached it last.

A level nobody has ever reached is still shown, dimmed and marked *Never reached* - the band
describes what a release has to go through, not only what has already happened. Clicking the build
named on a card selects it in the inspector below, loading further pages of builds if that build is
older than the ones currently shown.

The band is hidden entirely on a branch with no promotion levels, and on a branch with no builds:
a full row of never-reached stages above an empty timeline states the obvious loudly.

### The build timeline

![The build timeline of the Pipeline view](branch-pipeline-timeline.png)

The builds of the branch, most recent first, as cards rather than rows: version, build name,
promotions reached, and how many of the validations selected by the validation filter have passed.

The timeline obeys the same [build filter](../build-filtering/index.md) as the Builds view, and
loads further builds on demand. Clicking a card selects that build.

Builds can also be selected in **pairs** here, with the same checkboxes as in the Builds view, to
produce a [change log](../../integrations/changelogs/changelogs.md) between them.

### The build inspector

![The build inspector of the Pipeline view](branch-pipeline-inspector.png)

Everything that is true of the one build currently selected: its promotions, with the button to
promote it further, and its validations with their status.

The selected build is part of the address, as a `?build=` parameter, so a build worth showing
someone can be linked to directly. Opening such a link selects the build it names even when that
build is old enough not to be in the first page of the timeline.

When no build is named, the most recent one is selected.

## The Delivery map view

!!! warning "Experimental"

    The Delivery map view is experimental and still being refined. It is marked as such in the
    product, with a flask icon next to its entry in the View menu and a dismissible banner on the
    view itself. Feedback is welcome in
    [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/yontrack/yontrack/discussions).

The Delivery map answers a third question: *what does a build on this branch still have to pass
through on its way to an environment, and what depends on what*.

![The Delivery map view of a branch](branch-delivery-map-view.png)

It is **configuration with progress painted onto it**, not a history. Every checkpoint on it is
something a build has to reach, and every line between two of them is a dependency someone
configured. Nothing on it is inferred from what has happened; a map with no lines is a project
whose promotion and deployment rules have not been written down, not a project with no history.

### Checkpoints

A *checkpoint* is one of the things the map is made of. There are three kinds, and each one names
the latest build to have **arrived** at it and when.

| Checkpoint       | Arrived at by            | The build it names                                    |
|------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Promotion level  | being promoted           | the latest build of this branch promoted there        |
| Validation stamp | a run of *any* outcome   | the latest build of this branch run there, with its status |
| Slot             | a deployment             | the most recently deployed build, **whatever its branch** |
| Unresolved       | nothing, ever            | none - see [when a rule points at nothing](#when-a-rule-points-at-nothing) |

Arriving is not the same as succeeding, which is why only the validation stamp shows a status: a
build can arrive at a stamp and fail there, while a build cannot be promoted and fail.

![A validation stamp showing a build which arrived and failed](branch-delivery-map-failed.png)

Every promotion level of the branch is on the map, connected or not - a level with no configuration
behind it is exactly the thing you want to see. Validation stamps are the opposite: only the ones
taking part in a dependency are drawn, because an unconnected stamp teaches nothing on a map whose
subject is dependencies, and a branch with forty of them would have no readable layout. A promotion
whose [auto promotion](../model/auto-promotion.md) selects stamps *by pattern* gets one
*aggregate checkpoint* labelled with the pattern, standing for all of them; click it to see the
stamps it covers.

### How far behind the branch is

A checkpoint naming build 42 means little until you know the branch is at 47. The view's header names
the branch's **latest build**, and every checkpoint says how far behind that build its own is:

![The toolbar of the Delivery map view](branch-delivery-map-toolbar.png)

* **at head** - the latest build of the branch has reached this checkpoint;
* **3 behind** - three more recent builds of the branch have not.

The count is in **builds**, not in time. How long ago a build got there is the timestamp beside it,
and it answers a different question: a checkpoint reached an hour ago by a build from last week is
not up to date.

The latest build is stated once, in the header, and is deliberately **not** drawn as a checkpoint on
the map. Every line on the map means *unlocks* or *requires*; a line from the latest build to each
checkpoint would mean neither, and would fan out across the whole map at once. Twenty checkpoints each
stating their own lag are read one at a time.

A slot showing a build of **another branch** carries no marker at all. Counting that build against
this branch's latest one would answer a question nobody asked, and would answer it with a number,
which reads as a fact rather than as a mistake.

### Dependencies

Lines run from the prerequisite to the thing that depends on it, and come in two kinds, drawn
differently:

| Kind         | Means                                                    | Labelled  | Comes from                                   |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------|
| **unlocks**  | reaching the source grants the target by itself           | *unlocks* | auto promotion                               |
| **requires** | the target cannot be reached until the source has been    | *required by* | promotion dependencies, slot admission rules, the previous promotion condition |

The label on a line is read **along the arrow**, which is why the second one reads *required by*
rather than *requires*: `SILVER required by GOLD` is the line `GOLD requires SILVER` draws.

The distinction matters because the two are configured in ways with opposite effects. Auto
promotion *acts*: pass the validations and the promotion happens. A promotion dependency or an
admission rule only *constrains*: it permits, and something else still has to do the promoting or
the deploying.

#### The previous promotion condition

The [previous promotion condition](../../generated/properties/property-net.nemerosa.ontrack.extension.general.PreviousPromotionConditionPropertyType.md) is the third source of
*requires* lines, and the only one that is not configured on the thing it constrains. It says that a
promotion cannot be granted before the level immediately below it on the branch, and it is looked up
in turn on the **promotion level**, then the **branch**, then the **project**, then in the global
settings — the first of those to carry it decides, whichever way it answers. A `false` on the
promotion level therefore genuinely overrides a `true` on the project; it is an answer, not a gap.

The map draws the line wherever that lookup ends in *yes*, wherever the answer came from. Drawing it
only where the property sits on the promotion level itself would show a strict subset of what will
actually block, and an absent line reads as *nothing stops me*.

What the map does **not** say is where in that chain the condition was set — a line looks the same
whether it comes from the promotion level or from the global settings, and it looks the same as a
promotion dependency naming the same pair. Where both say the same thing, one line is drawn. The
question this leaves open — *why can I not promote?* — is answered exactly by trying: the refusal
names the entity that decided.

Because only the level immediately below is ever named, a branch with five promotion levels draws at
most four of these lines: one path down the ladder, not a web across it.

#### A requires that duplicates an unlocks is not drawn

Where the same directed pair carries both kinds — A auto-promotes into B, *and* something says B
requires A — only the **unlocks** line is drawn. Auto promotion goes through the same promotion path
as everything else, so the constraint is checked and passes, every time, because the level that
would block is the one that just triggered the promotion. It can never fire, and two lines with
opposite readings on one pair would say that something might block when nothing can.

This applies to every source of a *requires*, promotion dependencies included: a dependency
shadowing an auto promotion is configuration that can never have an effect, and the map shows the
one line that is true.

### Slots on the map

The map draws every [slot](../../integrations/environments/environments.md) of the branch's
project, and joins them to the rest from the slot's own admission rules:

* a **promotion** admission rule draws a *requires* line from that promotion level to the slot. The
  promotion is resolved by name **on this branch**, so the same slot configuration produces a
  different line on every branch - which is exactly why slots belong on a branch view at all;
* an **environment** admission rule - "must already be deployed in *staging*" - draws a *requires*
  line from that slot to this one.

A rule naming something that does not exist still draws its line, into an
[unresolved checkpoint](#when-a-rule-points-at-nothing).

Slot-to-slot lines come **only** from that rule. The map deliberately does not fall back to the
order of the environments, the way the project's slot graph does. Ordering says which environment
comes first; it never says that one deployment requires another. Where nobody configured the rule
there is no line, and the slots hang off their promotion checkpoints without joining up to each
other.

That makes the map look sparser than the chain drawn on the project's environments page, and the
sparseness is the point: it is the reading which shows you a slot nobody wired up, rather than one
which invents a dependency you never declared. Adding the environment admission rule to the slot
both fixes the deployment and fills in the line.

Two things about a slot are unlike every other checkpoint.

**A slot may name a build from another branch.** A slot shows what is deployed in it, and what is
deployed in production is a fact about the project rather than about the branch you happen to be
reading. When that build is not of this branch, the map says so beside it. The alternative - showing
nothing - would read as *nothing is in production*, which is the most damaging thing the map could
get wrong.

**A slot this branch can never reach is marked unreachable, and names no build.** If an admission
rule excludes the branch by name or pattern, no build of it can ever deploy there however far it is
promoted. Such a slot is still drawn, because "you cannot get there from here" is the most important
answer the map can give; leaving it out silently would leave you wondering why production is missing.

![A maintenance branch whose production slot is unreachable](branch-delivery-map-unreachable.png)

Both pictures above are the same two slots, read from two branches of one project: the main branch
reaches production and finds a maintenance build occupying staging, while the maintenance branch
cannot reach production at all.

### When a rule points at nothing

Both slot admission rules name their target **by name**: "requires the *GOLD* promotion", "requires
a deployment in *staging*". Nothing checks that the name matches anything. A rule can name a
promotion level the branch does not have, or an environment the project has no slot in, and the
configuration will be saved and will look perfectly healthy on the slot's own page.

Until somebody tries to deploy. Then the deployment refuses, with *Promotion not existing*, and that
is the first anyone hears of it.

The map draws such a rule as an **unresolved checkpoint**, carrying the name the rule asked for and
marked as matching nothing, with the rule's line running out of it as usual.

![A slot admission rule naming a promotion and a slot which do not exist](branch-delivery-map-unresolved.png)

Drawing nothing at all was the alternative, and it is the wrong one - the map would then quietly
agree with the broken configuration. This is arguably the strongest reason to look at the map: it
turns a misconfiguration nobody can see into something visible on a page people already open.

An unresolved checkpoint is **never** what a checkpoint you are not allowed to see looks like.
Something hidden by permissions is left out of the map entirely, together with every line touching
it - it does not become an unresolved checkpoint, and it never will. The two would otherwise be
impossible to tell apart, people would read "unresolved" as "probably just permissions", and the map
would stop being trustworthy for exactly the case it exists to catch.

The fix is never on the map, which is a reading of the configuration and not the configuration
itself: either create what the rule names, or change the rule on the slot to name what exists.

### Filters, and what the map does with them

The map obeys the validation stamp filter, which sits above the view switch like every other filter
and follows you from one view to the next. The filter touches validation stamps only: hiding a
promotion level or a slot because of a *validation* filter would be a different claim entirely. An
aggregate checkpoint disappears when the filter leaves it standing for nothing, and any line left
with a missing end goes with it.

### What the map draws, and how it draws it

Two sets of controls, and the difference between them is worth knowing.

**What is on the map** is chosen in the view's own toolbar, beside the latest build. **Show ›
Validation stamps** takes every stamp checkpoint off the map, aggregates included, together with the
lines which ended on one. It is on by default - a map opening on a chain of promotions with no
visible cause hides the very thing which explains them - and off is worth having on a branch whose
stamps outnumber everything else on screen. The choice is remembered in **your browser**, per screen
rather than per account, unlike the view selection itself.

**How the map is drawn** is the small control bar in the corner of the graph: zoom, fit, and a
**layout** button which puts the map back in order after you have dragged it about. Checkpoints can be
dragged; nothing on the map can be edited from it. It is a reading of the configuration, and the
configuration is changed where it lives - on the promotion level, on the branch, or on the slot the
checkpoint links to.

### Refreshing

**Auto refresh** in the toolbar reloads the map on an interval you pick, like the other graphs of the
product.

The map does **not** rearrange itself when it refreshes. Almost nothing on it changes minute to
minute: the configuration is static, and what moves is which build has arrived where. So a refresh
that finds the same checkpoints and the same lines updates the builds in place and leaves every
checkpoint where it is - including any you dragged. The layout is recomputed only when the map's
*shape* has genuinely changed: a checkpoint or a line appearing or disappearing.

## Not to be confused with

The word *pipeline* is used for two unrelated things in Yontrack:

* the **Pipeline view** described here, which is a way of reading a branch, and changes nothing;
* the **deployment pipeline** of the [environments](../../integrations/environments/environments.md)
  feature, which is a real object with a lifecycle - created, deploying, deployed - representing one
  attempt to deploy a build into an environment slot.
