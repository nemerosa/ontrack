# Yontrack model

![Model](model.png)

At the core, Yontrack collects information using an information model composed of the following entities:

* [projects](#projects)
* [branches](#branches)
* [branches](#builds)

Branches are configured with a list of [validation stamps](#validation-stamps)
and [promotions levels](#promotion-levels)
that builds can be associated with [validation runs](#validation-runs) and [promotions](#promotions).

Finally, each entity in Yontrack can be associated with [properties](#properties), which enrich the model with
additional information.
