/**
 * Puts the project's slots on the delivery map of a branch, and draws the *requires* edges its
 * admission rules ask for.
 *
 * This is the map's third checkpoint kind and the only one the core has never heard of. It reaches
 * the map through the plain `List<DeliveryMapContributor>` injection, so a Yontrack without the
 * environments extension - or without a licence for it - simply has one contributor fewer and a map
 * of promotion levels and validation stamps.
 *
 * *Every* slot of the project is drawn, including the ones no admission rule connects to anything
 * and the ones this branch can never reach. A slot is something a build has to pass through on its
 * way to an environment whether or not the configuration says how, and the map's subject is exactly
 * that journey.
 *
 * Slot to slot edges come **only** from [EnvironmentSlotAdmissionRule]. There is no fallback to
 * environment ordering, which is what the project slot graph uses: ordering says which environment
 * comes first, never that one deployment requires another. Where nobody configured the rule there is
 * no edge, and the slots hang off their promotion checkpoints unconnected to each other. That is
 * sparser than the chain the project slot graph draws, and it is the reading which surfaces the
 * misconfiguration rather than inventing a dependency nobody declared.
