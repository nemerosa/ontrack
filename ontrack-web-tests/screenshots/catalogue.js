/**
 * What gets photographed, and how to know the page is ready to be photographed.
 *
 * This is the part that changes; the capture mechanics in `capture.spec.js` do not. A feature
 * that wants a release-notes screenshot adds one entry here.
 *
 * Every entry is backed by the demo seed, so the names below mirror `DemoContent` in
 * `ontrack-demo-seed`. Changing a name there without changing it here leaves this suite
 * navigating to a page that does not exist - which is the intended failure: a screenshot of
 * the wrong data is worse than no screenshot.
 *
 * Entry shape:
 *
 * - `slug`        lower-case kebab, the second half of `<version>-<slug>.png`
 * - `description` what the shot is for, printed in the run summary
 * - `path`        rooted path, appended to DEMO_URL
 * - `ready`       runs before the shutter, and is the only assertion this suite makes
 * - `element`     optional selector: shoot this element instead of the whole page
 *
 * On `ready`: assert *positive evidence* that the data arrived - a populated row, a link named
 * after a seeded entity. Never a timeout, and never the absence of a loading indicator.
 * Yontrack renders those only while loading, so "the spinner is hidden" is already true before
 * the fetch starts. Section test ids are no better: `PageSection` puts `data-testid` on the
 * Card and swaps a Skeleton in underneath, so the section is visible throughout its own load.
