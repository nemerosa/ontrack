 * Captures the release-notes screenshots from the demo.
 *
 * Run on demand by .github/workflows/demo-screenshots.yml when someone is writing the release
 * notes for a version - see doc/dev-guide/demo-screenshots.md. It reports nothing to Yontrack
 * and gates no promotion: the demo is the source of the images, not a step in the pipeline.
 *
 * It does not seed. `demo-smoke.yml` already resets and seeds the demo deterministically as
 * part of SILVER, and one system owning the demo's state is worth more than a guarantee here.
 *
 * The pages, how to know each is ready, and whether the shot is of the page or of one element,
 * are in `catalogue.js`.
