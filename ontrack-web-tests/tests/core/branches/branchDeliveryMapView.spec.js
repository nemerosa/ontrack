/**
 * The delivery map branch content view: what a build on this branch has to pass through on its way to
 * an environment.
 *
 * What is checked here is what only a browser can answer - that the configuration a project actually
 * carries is drawn, that a checkpoint names the build which reached it and says how far behind the
 * branch head that build is, that the toolbar's toggle takes the validation stamps off the map and is
 * remembered, and that a rule naming nothing is drawn rather than silently dropped. The narrowing
 * rules, the topology comparison behind the refresh, and every empty-state predicate are pinned by
 * the Jest tests, which cover them far faster.

 * - BRONZE unlocks SILVER, and so does the QUALITY stamp - auto promotion is the only thing which

 * - GOLD requires SILVER, which is the other edge kind;
 * - LONELY is a stamp no promotion depends on, and is therefore NOT on the map;
 * - two builds, so that the head and the lag markers have something to say.
