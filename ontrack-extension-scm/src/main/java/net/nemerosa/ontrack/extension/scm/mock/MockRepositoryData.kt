/**
 * Snapshot of a [MockSCMExtension.MockRepository], which is what a [MockSCMStore] keeps
 * between two runs of the process.
 *
 * The snapshot is deliberately a set of types of its own rather than the mock SCM's runtime
 * ones: those carry computed fields and mutable collections, and this is **not** a storage
 * format anything is meant to depend on. It exists so that a long-lived demo or development
 * instance does not lose its mock data on a restart; nothing reads it but the mock SCM, and
 * a version of Yontrack is free to drop whatever it finds there.
 *
 * The one property it does have to keep is the one commit ids are derived from: the order of
 * the branches and the position of a commit on its branch. A repository restored from a
 * snapshot and then written to has to number the next commit exactly as the process that
 * wrote the snapshot would have.
