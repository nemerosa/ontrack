/**
 * Registering mock SCM content over GraphQL.
 *
 * [MockSCMController] does the same over REST, and is what the acceptance tests use for
 * everything else. These three exist because they are the ones the **demo seed** needs, and
 * the demo is reached through an ingress that routes `/graphql` and `/hook` to the backend
 * and everything else to the Next UI: a `POST /extension/scm/mock/commit` there answers 404
 * from the UI, whatever this instance is configured with.
 *
 * Like the rest of the mock SCM, they exist only where
 * `ontrack.config.extension.scm.mock.enabled` is set — and, unlike the REST endpoints, they
 * are reachable from outside the cluster, so each one asks for a global function rather than
 * settling for an authenticated user.
