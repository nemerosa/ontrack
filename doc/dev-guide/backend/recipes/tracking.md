# Tracking

While some links between entities are tracked statically (like a branch being linked to its project), we often need to track dynamic relationships, like an auto-versioning request to a promotion run, etc.

This mechanism is called _tracking_.

> This mechanism is in place for the auto-versioning but is not applied yet to other types of entities. This will happen in the future.
