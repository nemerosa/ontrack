# The mobile UI

Yontrack serves two user interfaces from one instance: the desktop UI, at the root, and a
phone-sized one under `/mobile`. This page describes the shell they share the instance
through — the redirect, the boundary between them, and the route map that decides what a
phone sees. The mobile screens themselves are documented as they land.

## Why two UIs rather than one responsive one

The desktop UI has no responsive design at all: no `useBreakpoint`, no layout media queries,
no antd responsive grid props across roughly 1260 components and 62k lines. Retrofitting that
is a much larger and riskier change than building a small, purpose-built app for the handful
of things people actually do from a phone — check a build, promote it, deploy it.

The trade is that the mobile UI is deliberately **incomplete**. It covers a few flows well
rather than everything badly, and it says so when a user arrives somewhere it does not cover.

## What is shared, and what is not

| Shared | Not shared |
|---|---|
| Services, GraphQL fragments and mutations | Every layout component |
| Authorization helpers | `MainLayout`, `MainPage`, `MainPageBar`, `NavBar`, `UserMenu` |
| Theme tokens (`styles/globals.css`) and the pre-paint theme script | The mobile shell: `MobileLayout`, `MobileHeader`, `MobileBottomNav` |
| The next-auth session and the `/api/protected/graphql` proxy | The provider stack — see below |

Keep that boundary sharp. Sharing a layout component between the two UIs means a change made
for one silently deforms the other, in a viewport whoever made the change is not looking at.

`/mobile` is its own App Router root, with its own `<html>` and `<body>` — exactly like the
sign-in page under `app/(auth)`. It is therefore covered by neither `pages/_document.js` nor
the provider stack in `pages/_app.js`, and assembles its own in `app/mobile/MobileProviders.js`.
Theme resolution before the first paint uses the same `themeInitScript` both other roots use.

### The header's brand

The identity is the two brand marks, `yontrack-logo.svg` and `yontrack-text.svg`, and not the
word "Yontrack" set in the UI font: the wordmark is a drawn typeface in brand lilac, and
typing the name loses both the letterforms and the colour. Both marks carry their own colours
— brand green and brand lilac — which read on the header's purple in either theme, because
the header is that purple in both.

Each is drawn at **its own aspect ratio** (27×24 and 129×16). Next compares what it renders
against the `width`/`height` it was given and warns when the two disagree, which is what the
desktop `NavBar` does by putting the 8.08:1 wordmark in a 120×24 box. The wordmark is set
shorter than the mark is tall because at the mark's 24px it would be 194px wide — half of a
375px header.

`priority` is deliberately not set on either. Next reports the mark as the largest contentful
paint and suggests it, but adding it does not silence the warning and Next 13 implements it by
passing React a camelCase `fetchPriority`, which React 18.3 rejects on every render. Both marks
are inline SVGs of about a kilobyte, served straight from `/public` — `next/image` passes SVGs
through rather than sending them to the optimizer, which answers `400` for them.

## The redirect

`middleware.js` sends phones to `/mobile`:

- **User agent detection, phones only.** It is the only thing a middleware knows about the
  device; viewport width is a client-side fact and arrives far too late. Tablets keep the
  desktop UI — they have the width for it. The rules are written to fail *towards* the desktop
  UI, which is the complete one. See `components/mobile/userAgent.js`.
- **A redirect, not a rewrite.** The PWA is scoped to `/mobile`, and a scope only works if
  that path actually appears in the URL. It also makes mobile pages bookmarkable.
- **A `yontrack-ui=desktop` cookie opts out**, per device rather than per user. It is set by
  the interstitial's "open the desktop version" and cleared by the "Mobile version" entry in
  the desktop user menu. Both halves matter: without the second, a phone that once chose the
  desktop UI is stranded on it, and once the mobile UI is installed as a PWA there is no
  address bar to escape with.

  It is a **session** cookie, on purpose. The way back is that user-menu entry — and at phone
  width the desktop UI's own page bar overlaps its user-menu trigger, so a tap there lands on
  "New project" instead. The escape hatch is not reliably reachable on the devices it exists
  for, and making the page bar responsive is precisely the retrofit the mobile UI exists to
  avoid. Ending the opt-out with the browser session turns "stranded for good" into "stranded
  until the browser restarts". Once the desktop page bar behaves at narrow widths, this can
  become a long-lived cookie.

The decision itself is a pure function in `components/mobile/mobileRedirect.js`, so it can be
tested without a request or the edge runtime. `middleware.js` is the adapter over it.

## The route map

`components/mobile/mobileRoutes.js` holds three things:

- `mobileEquivalent(pathname)` — the desktop routes that have a mobile screen. Deliberately
  short: a route earns an entry only once the mobile screen behind it exists and does the job.
  Two kinds of entry: exact paths, and **entity patterns** for the parameterised routes
  (`/project/[id]`, `/branch/[id]`), which carry the id through so a shared link keeps its
  subject. The patterns are exact — `/project/abc` and `/project/12/anything` fall through to
  the interstitial rather than to a screen that would ask the server an unanswerable question.
- `isRedirectExempt(pathname)` — the paths the redirect must not touch at all: `/mobile`,
  `/auth` (redirecting the sign-in page would loop), `/api`, `/display` and static files.
- `describeDesktopRoute(pathname)` — what to call a desktop route in the interstitial.

A phone whose destination has no mobile equivalent lands on the **interstitial**
(`/mobile/desktop-only`), which names where they were going and offers both ways out. Neither
of the easy alternatives is acceptable: silently serving the desktop page costs the user the
readable UI the redirect exists to give them, and silently dropping them on the mobile home
loses what they came for.

**A route named after an entity can be swallowed by `.gitignore`.** `/mobile/build/[id]` lives
in a directory called `build`, and the repository's `.gitignore` carries an unanchored `build`
for Gradle output — so the screen's files were ignored, and silently: they exist on disk, the
app runs, the unit tests pass and `git status` shows nothing. Only a fresh checkout notices.
Each such directory has to be re-included by name in `.gitignore`, and the *directory* itself
has to be, because git never descends into an excluded one.

**Adding a desktop route means deciding what a phone following a link to it should see.** That
decision is recorded in this map — a desktop route added without one silently sends phones to
the interstitial, which may well be right, but should be a choice rather than an oversight.

## The screens

| Screen | Route | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| Home | `/mobile` | The user's favourite projects and branches |
| Projects | `/mobile/projects` | Every project, filterable by name, with the favourite toggle |
| Project | `/mobile/project/[id]` | The project's branches, limited and filterable |
| Branch | `/mobile/branch/[id]` | The branch's latest builds, as cards |
| Build | `/mobile/build/[id]` | The decision surface: promotions, deployments, validations |
| Search | `/mobile/search` | Not built yet — placeholder |
| Interstitial | `/mobile/desktop-only` | A route with no mobile equivalent |

Home → project → branch → build is the path the mobile UI exists for, and all of it stays
inside `/mobile`: every row links to a mobile route, never to a desktop one. A desktop link
would bounce through the redirect and, once the app is installed as a PWA scoped to that
prefix, out of the app itself.

**Home is the favourites, not a project list.** Someone reaching for their phone is checking
something they already care about; the full list is one tap away in the bottom bar for the
times it is not. Both screens read the existing `projects(favourites: true)` and
`branches(favourite: true)` — the mobile UI adds no GraphQL of its own.

A user who has never curated favourites on the desktop UI would otherwise open a blank home
screen, which reads as a broken app rather than as an empty list. Two things stop that: the
empty state (`MobileFavouritesEmpty`), which says what favourites are and links to the
project list, and the favourite toggle on the project list, which is where those favourites
get made. The demo seed marks a couple of its own, so the demo is populated on a phone —
see `doc/dev-guide/demo-seed.md`.

### Favourites

`MobileFavourite` is **controlled**: the favourite state lives in the list that renders the
toggle, and the toggle owns only whether its own call is in flight. Its parent then refetches
rather than patching its copy of the list, so there is one answer to "is this a favourite"
and it is the server's. `useFavouriteRefresh` is that refetch: a counter in the screen's
`deps` and the `onToggled` its stars share.

It is deliberately not the desktop `Favourite`, which is a 14px icon inside a
`Typography.Text` with a click handler — neither a 44px touch target nor a control a screen
reader announces. Same four mutations, own affordance; the mapping from entity type to
mutation is a pure module, `components/mobile/favourites/favouriteMutations.js`.

The mobile provider stack has no `EventsContextProvider`, so a screen cannot refresh off the
`project.favourite` page event the desktop widgets use. A local counter in the screen's
`deps` does the same job for one screen, which is all a phone shows at a time.

That absence has one consequence worth knowing: `useEventForRefresh` reads a context whose
default value is an empty object, so a shared primitive that only ever wants the refresh —
`EntityIcon`, and so every promotion medal — would throw and take a whole mobile screen with
it. The hook now calls `subscribeToEvent?.()`. Outside a provider nothing is ever fired, so
a counter stuck at 0 is the right answer rather than a degraded one.

### The project screen

`/mobile/project/[id]` is the project's branches and nothing else. The desktop project page
carries branch boxes with their last promotions, decorations, an info drawer and a row of
commands; none of that is what someone opens on a phone for. They are on their way to a
branch, and from there to a build.

The branch list is **limited and filterable**, for the reason the project list is: a project
can hold hundreds of branches and a phone shows a handful of rows. It asks for
`MOBILE_BRANCH_LIMIT + 1` branches ordered by build activity (`branches(count:, order: true)`)
and shows the limit: `branches` answers with a plain list and no total, so the extra row is
the only way to know whether anything was left out — and it costs exactly one row. When it
was, the screen says so and points at the filter, which is how a branch beyond the limit is
reached.

Neither screen has a "no such project/branch" state of its own. `project(id:)` is a nullable
field and `branch(id:)` is not, but it makes no difference: the server never answers a bad id
with a null — it raises `ProjectNotFoundException`, or `AccessDeniedException` for one the
user cannot see — and both arrive as GraphQL *errors* carrying the reason. The error alert
already says what happened, and a null-checking branch beside it would be code that never
runs.

### The branch screen

`/mobile/branch/[id]` is the one screen that genuinely diverges rather than restyling.
`BranchBuilds` renders builds as a matrix with a column per validation stamp: wide by
construction, and no amount of narrowing turns a matrix into something readable at 375px. A
phone gets **a card per build** instead (`MobileBuildCard`) — what the build is called, when
it happened, how far it has been promoted, and where it is deployed.

- The name is `displayName`, which is already the release property when there is one. A build
  name is a timestamp-run pair, not a version.
- Promotions are `promotionRuns(lastPerLevel: true)`, drawn as the level's medal **beside its
  name**. The acceptance criterion is that promotions read without zooming, and a 16px medal
  on a phone is a coloured dot.
- Deployments are `Build.currentDeployments` — where the build is *now*, which is the question
  a phone user has; the pipeline history is a desktop surface. **Asked for in a query of its
  own** — see below.

  **Known gap: qualified slots are not shown.** `currentDeployments` declares its `qualifier`
  argument with a default of `""`, and `findSlotsByProject` treats that as a *strict* filter
  rather than as "any", so the field only ever answers with unqualified slots — a build
  deployed into a qualified one shows no badge. The two honest alternatives are both worse
  for now: `slotPipelines(status: DEPLOYED)` answers with deployments since superseded by a
  newer build, and reproducing "last deployed pipeline per slot, if it is this build" over
  `Build.slots` puts a server rule in a second place. Fixing the argument's default is a
  backend change with its own blast radius.
- Validation status is deliberately absent: per-stamp status is the build screen's job, and a
  strip of validation chips here would rebuild the matrix one card at a time.

"Load more" grows the page rather than accumulating pages in the browser. Merging pages by
hand means owning a second copy of the list and keeping it in step with the favourite
toggle's refetches; refetching a longer first page cannot drift.

### The build screen

`/mobile/build/[id]` is the **decision surface**: everything needed to answer "should I
promote or deploy this build?", and then act. Identity, promotions with their times and
authors, current deployments, validations, and the two action entry points.

**Validations are here on purpose**, though validations are otherwise out of scope for the
mobile UI. Someone about to promote or deploy from a phone needs to know whether the build
passed; leaving it out would mean switching to the desktop UI to check and switching back,
which defeats the flow the whole initiative exists to enable. They are a read-only list and
nothing more — no matrix, no filter, no drill-down into a run — drawn with the shared
`ValidationChip`, which spells the status out in words and repeats its glyph, so the state
survives greyscale.

The actions sit directly under the identity rather than at the foot of the screen. The issue
lists them last, but a validation list can be long and a user who already knows they want to
promote should not scroll past every stamp to reach the button.

#### Deployments are a separate query, deliberately

`Build.currentDeployments` is contributed by the environments extension, and
`GQLBuildSlotPipelinesFieldContributor` only registers it when
`environmentsLicense.environmentFeatureEnabled`. On an instance without that licence the
field is **absent from the schema**, not merely empty — so a query naming it fails
*validation*, and a GraphQL validation failure fails the whole document. A single query would
therefore take identity, promotions, validations and both action buttons down with it, and
the screen would read "Could not load the build" on the strength of a licence it never
mentions.

The desktop UI does not hit this because its environments panel is its own component with its
own query: only that panel breaks. `useMobileDeployments` gives the mobile screens the same
isolation — one hook for a build, one for a page of a branch's builds — and its `error` is an
expected state rather than a bug. The build screen says "Deployments are not available on this
instance", which is a different sentence from "This build is not deployed anywhere"; a build
card on the branch screen simply draws no badges, the difference not being worth a sentence
there.

Any future mobile query naming a field an extension contributes conditionally needs the same
treatment.

#### The action entry points

`MobileBuildActions` gates them off the build's own `authorizations`, exactly as the desktop
UI does: `build/promote` and `slotPipeline/create`. A user without the right sees no button
rather than one that fails — and the second is answered `false` on an instance with no
environments licence, so the deploy entry point disappears there without the component
knowing anything about licences.

**What they do today.** Promoting (#1724) and deploying (#1725) are their own issues; #1722
delivered the entry points and the gating. Until those land the buttons switch this device to
the desktop UI on the build's own page, through the same `switchToDesktopUI` cookie-then-
navigate pair the interstitial uses — and a caption under them says so. The alternative was a
button that does nothing, which is worse than one that is honest about where it goes. When
the two action issues land, each `onClick` becomes its dialog and the caption goes.

### Filtering a long list

An instance holds hundreds of projects and a project holds hundreds of branches, which is
more than anyone scrolls through on a phone. Both lists filter by name, and both filter **on
the server**: the browser only holds the answer to the last query, so a client-side filter
could narrow that but never reach a row the server had not already sent. The typing itself —
the debounce, the two values, the trim — lives once, in `useMobileFilter`.

What the two screens send differs, and the difference matters:

- `projects(pattern:)` is an `ILIKE '%…%'` ordered by name. The server refuses `pattern`
  alongside any *other* argument, and it tells "no pattern" from "empty pattern" by whether
  the argument was supplied at all — so the screen sends `null`, never `''`.
- `Project.branches(name:)` is **a regular expression**, matched with Postgres' `~`. Handing
  it the typed text raw would be wrong twice over: `release/1.0` would match `release/1x0`,
  and a lone `(` would not narrow the list but fail the whole query with an
  `INTERNAL_ERROR`. `branchNamePattern` escapes the text to a literal and prefixes `(?i)`,
  which Postgres' advanced regular expressions support — giving the same case-insensitive
  substring match the project list has, which is what a user moving between the two screens
  expects.

  It matches the branch's **name**, not its display name — the repository runs `B.NAME ~ ?`.
  A row therefore carries its name under its display name whenever the two differ, or a
  branch showing as `PRJ-1234` would look as though it had ignored a filter that in fact
  matched `feature/PRJ-1234-search`.

### The list shape

`MobileEntityGroup` and `MobileEntityRow` are the mobile UI's one list: a name, a line of
context under it, and a single trailing action. `MobileSection` is the heading half on its
own; `MobileSectionList` is that plus "a list, or a line saying there is none" — the build
screen's three sections; `MobileEntityGroup` is the heading plus a list that its screen has
already decided is non-empty. All three share the heading, so they cannot drift apart.
`MobileEmpty` is the one-line empty state itself, in one voice, using antd's simple image
rather than the desktop-sized default illustration. Plain `ul`/`li` rather than antd's `List`,
whose paddings and split lines are sized for a desktop page — and which is a layout
component, on the wrong side of the boundary above.

A row links to the screen behind it through its **text**, not through the whole row: the
trailing action is itself a control, and nesting a button inside an anchor is invalid markup
that browsers and screen readers then resolve differently. The text block grows to fill the
row, so everything left of the star is tappable anyway.

A row with no screen behind it takes no `href` — a tap that 404s is worse than a row that
does not move.

## Adding a mobile screen

1. Add the page under `app/mobile/`, replacing its `MobileScreenPending` placeholder if it has
   one. Keep the page itself to the route and put the screen in a client component beside it,
   as `app/mobile/page.js` and `app/mobile/HomeScreen.js` do.
2. Add the desktop route it stands in for to `components/mobile/mobileRoutes.js`, so phones
   stop getting the interstitial for it: `EQUIVALENTS` for a fixed path, `ENTITY_EQUIVALENTS`
   for one carrying an id.
3. If it belongs in the bottom bar, add it to `MOBILE_NAV_ITEMS` in
   `components/mobile/layout/mobileNav.js` — and think hard first: three destinations are what
   fits a thumb.
4. Cover it in `ontrack-web-tests/tests/core/mobile.spec.js`, whose tests run in a phone
   browser context.
