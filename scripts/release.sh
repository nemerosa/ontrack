#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# Publishes a Yontrack release.
#
# Called by .github/workflows/release.yml, which the GOLD promotion dispatches through the
# `github-workflow` notification channel. The logic lives here rather than inline in the
# workflow so that scripts/release-test.sh can exercise it against stubbed clients - and
# because most of what this file does is refuse to run, which is exactly the part worth
# testing.
#
# Usage: scripts/release.sh resolve|docs|wiki|body
#
#   resolve  Finds the build the version names, works out the version to publish, and refuses
#            to publish over anything that already exists. Outputs `version`, `rc_version`,
#            `build`, `build_id`, `run_id`, `sha` and `latest`; every later step is driven by
#            those.
#   docs     Finds the docs artefact on the CI run recorded on the build, before anything is
#            published. Outputs `artifact_id`.
#   wiki     Checks the release page exists in the wiki and is reachable from the index. A
#            check, not a publication step - the page is written by a human before GOLD.
#   body     Composes the GitHub release body: the wiki link first, the changelog second. Falls
#            back to the git range when Yontrack has no changelog to give, which is the normal
#            case on a freshly cut release branch.
#
# Environment:
#   YONTRACK_URL           Yontrack instance
#   YONTRACK_TOKEN         API token on it
#   RELEASE_BUILD_VERSION  version the GOLD promotion named, i.e. the build's display name
#                          at that point (`5.3.0-rc-100`)
#   RELEASE_VERSION        version to publish under; defaults to the base version
#   RELEASE_PROJECT        Yontrack project (default: yontrack)
#   RELEASE_BRANCH         Yontrack branch (default: main)
#   RELEASE_REPOSITORY     GitHub repository (default: yontrack/yontrack)
#   REL_WIKI_DIR           checkout of the wiki (default: wiki)
#   REL_VERSION            version being published, for the steps after `resolve`
#   REL_RC_VERSION         the rc version, i.e. the GHCR tag to re-tag from
#   REL_BUILD_ID           Yontrack build id, for the changelog boundary
#   REL_RUN_ID             CI run holding the docs artefact
#   REL_SHA                commit the release targets, and the upper bound of the changelog
#                          fallback
#
# The Yontrack CLI must already be installed and configured; `gh` must be authenticated.
