# resolve: the "Latest release" decision
# ===========================================================================

# `gh release create` defaults `make_latest` to true, so a 5.3.2 published after 5.4.0 would take
# the repository's "Latest release" badge and flip the README's shields.io version - announcing a
# patch of the previous minor as the current release. The decision is made here, next to
# `rel_check_unpublished`, which already reads the tag list.
